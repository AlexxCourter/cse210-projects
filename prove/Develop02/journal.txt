Date: 19/01/2024, Prompt: What experience taught you something new today?
I got held up by a difficult challenge while programming today. I had to figure out how to parse a text file in a way that would allow me to strip out all unneccessary things and leave only the parts that could be inserted into a class object's member variables. I learned about the different string modulation functions, uncluding split, remove, replace, and trim. Each one had to be used at a specific part of the process to augment the text file back into program readable data. I learned how to handle this type of task through this experience.
